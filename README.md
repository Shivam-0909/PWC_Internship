# **❖ PWC_Internship**

During the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I performed various tasks that helped me develop essential skills in data analysis and data visualization using Power BI.

## **Task 1: Call Centre Analysis**

I created a "Call Center Analysis" dashboard using Power BI. This dataset includes call records from a customer service center, detailing attributes such as Call ID, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, Answered (Yes/No), Resolved, Speed of Answer in seconds, and Average Talk Duration.

### **Objective:**

The dashboard aims to deliver meaningful insights and actionable information to enhance the Call Centre's performance.

### **Project Insights:**

**1. Customer Satisfaction:**
- Understanding the relationship between call resolution and customer satisfaction could provide valuable insights into service quality.
- Monitoring unresolved calls and their impact on customer satisfaction could be crucial for improving overall customer experience.

**2. Agent Performance:**
- Analyze the performance of individual agents based on metrics like average talk duration, resolution rate, and speed of answer.
- Top-performing agents like Martha and Diane could be identified for recognition or additional training, while areas for improvement could be highlighted for others.

**3. Training & Resource Allocation:**
- Identify topics with higher call volumes or longer average talk durations to indicate areas where additional training or resources may be needed.
- Optimize agent allocation based on call volumes and topics to improve efficiency and customer service quality.

**4. Resolution Rate:**
- Contract-related queries, Technical Support, and Payment-related calls show a high resolution rate.

**5. Topic Distribution:**
- Payment-related issues are the most common topic, followed by Technical Support and Contract-related queries.
- Admin Support and Streaming-related issues have lower call volumes compared to other topics.

**6. Speed of Answer:**
- The average speed of answer varies across different topics, with some having quicker response times.
- Admin Support and Contract-related calls tend to have faster response times compared to Technical Support and Payment-related calls.

**7. Peak Hours:**
- Certain peak hours or periods of the day when call volumes are higher could help in optimizing agent scheduling.
- 11 AM, 1 PM, and 5 PM are identified as peak hours.

✅ These insights can serve as a foundation for further analysis and decision-making aimed at improving customer service operations and enhancing overall customer 
   satisfaction.

## TASK 2: Customer Churn Analysis of PhoneNow Company.

 **As a part of the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I have created a Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard using Power BI.**

### Objective:
- The Telecommunications Retention Manager is actively seeking a comprehensive solution to elevate customer retention efforts and mitigate customer churn.

### Churn Rate:
- The churn rate, indicating the percentage of customers who stopped using the service during a certain time period, is a significant factor. Analyzing the churn rate helps understand why customers are leaving and allows for appropriate actions to reduce it.

### Demographic Analysis:
**1. Gender Distribution:**
- This section displays the count of customers based on their gender, categorized as male and female.

**2. Tenure:**
- The tenure of customers varies widely, ranging from 1 to 72 months, indicating both new and long-standing customers.

**3. Internet Service:**
- Fiber optic is the most popular internet service among customers, followed by DSL.

**4. Online Security & Tech Support:**
- Customers who subscribe to online security and tech support services have a lower churn rate as they value security and assistance.

**5. Contract Type:**
- Customers with longer contract durations (e.g., one year or two years) are less likely to churn compared to those on a month-to-month contract.

### Billing & Payment:
**1. Paperless Billing:**
- Customers opting for paperless billing may exhibit different behaviors compared to those receiving paper bills.

**2. Payment Method:**
- The choice of payment method (e.g., electronic check, credit card, bank transfer) might influence customer loyalty and churn rate.

**3. Monthly Charges:**
- Monthly charges vary across customers, with some paying as low as $20 and others over $100. Understanding these differences can help in pricing strategies and customer retention efforts.

### Insights of the Projects:
**1. Overview:**
- Total customers: 7043
- Retained customers: 5174
- Churned customers: 1869
- Retention rate: 73.46%
- Churn rate: 26.54%
- Yearly charges: $16.06M
- Monthly charges: $456.12K
- Tech tickets opened: 2955
- Admin tickets opened: 3632
- Senior citizens: 16.21% of total customers, 25.46% of churned customers

**2. Demographics:**
- Churn rate is higher for customers who opted for Internet Services.
- Customers with Fiber Optic services have a higher churn rate of 69.39%.
- Average tenure of customers: 32.37 months
- Average tenure of churned customers: 17.89 months
- Customers with lower tenure are more likely to churn.

**3. Subscription:**
- Tech support should be improved.
- Focus should be on customers with shorter tenures as they are more likely to churn.
- Since the churn rate is higher for fiber optic internet services, efforts should be made to retain these customers and improve services in this area.
- Encourage customers to subscribe to more services and opt for longer contract durations.

# Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard

 As a part of the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I developed a comprehensive **"𝐃𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 & 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧"** Dashboard using Power BI.

###  Strategic Partnership:
➤ A telecom client partnered with PwC Switzerland to enhance executive gender balance through robust diversity and inclusion initiatives.

###  Key Objectives:
➤ Develop key performance indicators (KPIs) related to hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover.  
➤ Create visualizations to track and communicate progress towards a valued and inclusive environment for all teams.

### Dashboard Features:
1. Number of Employees
2.  Number of Male Employees
3.  Number of Female Employees
4.  Hired Employees (Men vs. Women)
5.  Employees Promoted (FY20) & (FY21)
6.  Male Employees Promoted (FY20) & (FY21)
7.  Female Employees Promoted (FY20) & (FY21)
8.  Turnover Rate
9.  Average Performance Rating (Men)
10. Average Performance Rating (Women)

###  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- 𝐇𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠:
 Tracking the percentage of hires (Men vs. Women) provides visibility into recruitment practices, ensuring a balanced workforce from the outset.

- 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:
 Measuring the percentage of promotions (Men vs. Women) helps identify and celebrate talent, ensuring opportunities are equitable and merit-based.

- 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞:

### Final Goal:
The ultimate aim is to address gender balance challenges practically. This involves not only setting strategic objectives but also measuring, analyzing, and continuously improving diversity and inclusion initiatives.
