# **🌟 PWC_Internship 🌟**

During the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I performed various tasks that helped me develop essential skills in data analysis and data visualization using Power BI.

## **📊 Task 1: Call Centre Analysis**

I created a "Call Center Analysis" dashboard using Power BI. This dataset includes call records from a customer service center, detailing attributes such as Call ID, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, Answered (Yes/No), Resolved, Speed of Answer in seconds, and Average Talk Duration.

### **🎯 Objective:**

The dashboard aims to deliver meaningful insights and actionable information to enhance the Call Centre's performance.

### **🔍 Project Insights:**

**🌟 Customer Satisfaction:**
- Understanding the relationship between call resolution and customer satisfaction could provide valuable insights into service quality.
- Monitoring unresolved calls and their impact on customer satisfaction could be crucial for improving overall customer experience.

**📊 Agent Performance:**
- Analyze the performance of individual agents based on metrics like average talk duration, resolution rate, and speed of answer.
- Top-performing agents like Martha and Diane could be identified for recognition or additional training, while areas for improvement could be highlighted for others.

**🛠️ Training & Resource Allocation:**
- Identify topics with higher call volumes or longer average talk durations to indicate areas where additional training or resources may be needed.
- Optimize agent allocation based on call volumes and topics to improve efficiency and customer service quality.

**📈 Resolution Rate:**
- Contract-related queries, Technical Support, and Payment-related calls show a high resolution rate.

**📋 Topic Distribution:**
- Payment-related issues are the most common topic, followed by Technical Support and Contract-related queries.
- Admin Support and Streaming-related issues have lower call volumes compared to other topics.

**🕒 Speed of Answer:**
- The average speed of answer varies across different topics, with some having quicker response times.
- Admin Support and Contract-related calls tend to have faster response times compared to Technical Support and Payment-related calls.

**📊 Peak Hours:**
- Certain peak hours or periods of the day when call volumes are higher could help in optimizing agent scheduling.
- 11 AM, 1 PM, and 5 PM are identified as peak hours.

✅ These insights can serve as a foundation for further analysis and decision-making aimed at improving customer service operations and enhancing overall customer 
   satisfaction.

## TASK 2: Customer Churn Analysis of PhoneNow Company.

🌟 **As a part of the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I have created a Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard using Power BI.**

### 🔍 Objective:
- 📊 The Telecommunications Retention Manager is actively seeking a comprehensive solution to elevate customer retention efforts and mitigate customer churn.

### 📉 Churn Rate:
- 🔄 The churn rate, indicating the percentage of customers who stopped using the service during a certain time period, is a significant factor. Analyzing the churn rate helps understand why customers are leaving and allows for appropriate actions to reduce it.

### 👥 Demographic Analysis:
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Gender Distribution:**
- This section displays the count of customers based on their gender, categorized as male and female.

🕰️ **Tenure:**
- The tenure of customers varies widely, ranging from 1 to 72 months, indicating both new and long-standing customers.

🌐 **Internet Service:**
- Fiber optic is the most popular internet service among customers, followed by DSL.

🔒 **Online Security & Tech Support:**
- Customers who subscribe to online security and tech support services have a lower churn rate as they value security and assistance.

📝 **Contract Type:**
- Customers with longer contract durations (e.g., one year or two years) are less likely to churn compared to those on a month-to-month contract.

### 💳 Billing & Payment:
📄 **Paperless Billing:**
- Customers opting for paperless billing may exhibit different behaviors compared to those receiving paper bills.

💰 **Payment Method:**
- The choice of payment method (e.g., electronic check, credit card, bank transfer) might influence customer loyalty and churn rate.

💵 **Monthly Charges:**
- Monthly charges vary across customers, with some paying as low as $20 and others over $100. Understanding these differences can help in pricing strategies and customer retention efforts.

### 📊 Insights of the Projects:
📈 **Overview:**
- Total customers: 7043
- Retained customers: 5174
- Churned customers: 1869
- Retention rate: 73.46%
- Churn rate: 26.54%
- Yearly charges: $16.06M
- Monthly charges: $456.12K
- Tech tickets opened: 2955
- Admin tickets opened: 3632
- Senior citizens: 16.21% of total customers, 25.46% of churned customers

📉 **Demographics:**
- Churn rate is higher for customers who opted for Internet Services.
- Customers with Fiber Optic services have a higher churn rate of 69.39%.
- Average tenure of customers: 32.37 months
- Average tenure of churned customers: 17.89 months
- Customers with lower tenure are more likely to churn.

🔧 **Subscription:**
- Tech support should be improved.
- Focus should be on customers with shorter tenures as they are more likely to churn.
- Since the churn rate is higher for fiber optic internet services, efforts should be made to retain these customers and improve services in this area.
- Encourage customers to subscribe to more services and opt for longer contract durations.
